#based on the 'lnotify' script for weechat, which was based on 'notify'
#
#the main reason to use this script would be if you use tmux or screen
#with weechat and would like to receive desktop notifications on multiple
#computers (regardless of whether or not you are connected to weechat on
#any of those systems.) however, there is a reason to use this if you
#only use one system for weechat. if you restart X and then reconnect
#to weechat, notifications will no longer work because of dbus errors.
#this solution solves that problem at the expense of some extra setup.
#
#IMPORTANT:
#use of this script assumes that you have:
#1) /usr/bin/notify-send
#2) ssh configured to use key identification (including localhost!)
#
#ALSO IMPORTANT:
#see comments below in the default settings section for description of options
#and tips. pay particular attention to the addresses section if you need to
#specify non-default ports or non-default display settings
#
#NOT so important:
#if you define icons to show up in the notifications, this script will expect
#to find them in the same place on all systems. missing icons will not stop the
#notification from displaying, however. (this also applies for any extra
#commands you add to be executed after notify-send. sound files and utilities
#have to exist on the machine receiving the command in order to work)
#
#
#changelog:
#v0.2.3 - SÃ©bastien Helleu <flashcode@flashtux.org>
#         change hook_print callback argument type of displayed/highlight
#         (WeeChat >= 1.0)
#v0.2.2 - <ldvx@freenode> fixed bug in (1)  which didn't allow user to get
#         notifications on private messages if irc.look.nick_prefix or
#         irc.look.nick_suffix were used. (2012-04-27)
#v0.2.1 - added help messages and hint for empty addresses option (2011-10-15)
#v0.2.0 - added several options, including: proper weechat options
#         for multiple addresses, ignore strings, urgencies, images,
#         and extra commands to be sent along with notifications.
#         shifted handling of DISPLAY to the address portion of the command.
#         submitted to weechat scripts. (2011-10-14)
#v0.1.0 - converted lnotify to work via ssh. accepts multiple addresses
#         hardcoded into the script. (2011-09-18)
#
#TODO... if i get bored enough/anyone actually requests these things:
#         add notification whitelist, only send notifications matching whitelist
#         set up proper /sshnotify <args> command to manually send notifications
#         set up new definitions for messages so that extra_commands can use them?
#         toggle to suppress notifications when away
#         toggle to show server and channel names in notifications
#         toggle to show notifications for dcc?

"""
  This script allows you to send desktop
  notifications of private messages and
  highlighted strings to one or more
  computers via ssh. This script expects
  ssh key identification to be set up and
  /usr/bin/notify-send on the systems to
  which you are sending notifications.

  It is quite configurable, allowing you
  to specify any ssh options you might find
  necessary (e.g. custom ports and
  non-default DISPLAY settings.) It allows
  you to specify strings to be ignored to
  help cut down on notification spam. Both
  of these settings accept comma delimited lists.

  Examples:
  for multiple ssh connections:
  /set plugins.var.python.sshnotify.addresses
      localhost,foo@bar,-p 1234 bar@foo DISPLAY=:1
  (sends notifications to you@localhost, foo@bar,
   and bar@foo on port 1234 at DISPLAY 1)

  for multiple ignore values:
  /set plugins.var.python.sshnotify.ignore
      @root: jabber,@root: otr,ignore this string
  (I use these values to eliminate notification
   spam from bitlbee when I connect)

  It also allows you to chain extra commands
  to be executed after the notify-send command,
  like so:
  /set plugins.var.python.sshnotify.extra_commands
      && espeak 'you have a new message && aplay somerandom.wav
  (note: this is not comma delimited and expects '&&'
   in front of any command you wish to execute,
   including the first one.)

  You can also set the urgency level and icons
  used for private messages or highlighted
  strings (the 'mention' configure options.)
  Valid urgency levels are 'low','normal', and
  'critical'. Icons need to be on the system
  receiving the notification in order to display,
  but if they are missing it does not interfere
  with the functionality of this script.

  I should also note that apostrophes in messages
  will be converted to double quotes in your
  notifications due to formatting issues with
  the ssh/notify-send command.
